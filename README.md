Introduction

For our assignment 3 in UTS 41889 & 42889 Application Development in the iOS Environment, we developed an application to address procrastination and lack of motivation during study sessions.

Target Audience and Problem Being Solved
Our primary target audience is students who struggle with procrastination and lack of motivation. This application aims to engage students in their studies, reducing distractions and emphasizing the importance of focused study sessions.

Comparison to Other Solutions
Our app gamifies the study process, similar to the Forest app. However, instead of growing a forest, users earn credits to customize and level up a game character. This dynamic character changes to simulate studying alongside the user, providing continuous motivation. Unlike Forest, our app offers milestone rewards and study session multipliers to maintain engagement and focus.

Key Features
Set Study Times: Use the built-in Pomodoro timer.
Earn Credits: Gain rewards by reaching study milestones.
Customize Characters: Personalize and level up your game character with earned credits.
Dynamic Characters: Experience character changes that simulate studying with you.
Study Multipliers: Benefit from multipliers that encourage consistent focus.
How to Use the App
Home Screen: Access main features like Timer, Character, Timeline, and Account.
Timer: Set study sessions and break intervals using the Pomodoro technique.
Character Selection: Choose and customize your character using earned credits.
Timeline: Track your study sessions and progress.
Account: Manage your profile and view your earned credits.
Greatest Difficulty and Solution
The most challenging aspect was managing an ambitious design. We streamlined features to maintain focus and used Figma to create UI frames, ensuring realistic and achievable design implementation.

Frameworks/Services Used
Figma: For UI design.
GitHub: For source code repository and version control.
Iterative Product Design Cycle
We focused on product research and reviews to identify key issues. Sketches and Figma frames helped maintain design consistency. Despite limited user testing, our app follows the intended UI design and remains a work in progress.
